# Ribbit Royale
## Abstract
Ribbit Royale is an exciting and whimsical LAN party game designed to bring players together through fun, competitive, and engaging multiplayer minigames.
Featuring a playful art style and a variety of unique, frog-themed interactions, the game invites players to experience amusing challenges that leverage the distinct abilities of frogsâ€”such as swinging with their tongues, licking to interact with the environment, and even eating other players or flies.

## Objective
The objective is to provide a distinctive experience that blends competitive gameplay with quirky mechanics, making each mini-game feel fresh and enjoyable. Players can compete in up to four-player multiplayer mode, with a series of mini-games designed to test their skills and cooperation. Ribbit Royale offers at least three unique games with visually differentiated elements that make each challenge memorable and fun. Through the creation of this game, we aim to push the boundaries of the typical party game genre by incorporating fun mechanics that highlight the playful essence of frogs, making it not only an entertaining experience for players but also an intriguing marketable product. And best of all, our product will be made ***FREE***, putting us ahead of our competitors. 

## How to Build and Test
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/abobich675/Ribbit-Royale.git.
- Open the project in Unity (ensure the correct Unity version is installed).
- Build the project by selecting File > Build Settings and then choosing your target platform.
- Click Build and Run to compile and launch the game.
- Use Unity Test Runner to run tests

## How to Run the System
- The current released version of the game can be found in the Release_Builds folder of the repository (https://github.com/abobich675/Ribbit-Royale/tree/master/Release_Builds). Locate the build for your computer architecture. Downloading and running the build will allow you to play Ribbit Royale.
- To run the game using the latest version of the repository, regardless of the last released build you must create your own build file, following the instructons above.

## Who Worked on What:
- Baron Baker: "Snake Chase" minigame and background art
- Chase Bennett: Lead of sound design
- Adam Bobich: "Lickity Split" and "Swamp Spotting" minigames lead developer
- Aidan Caughey: Lead of art design, options menu and lead of testing and problem detection
- Luke Garci: Networking, lobby management, multiplayer management and UI
- Ryan Dobkin: UI and Scoreboard functionality

## Current State of the Game
The game is currently in early production, so not all game features are implemented yet. Here are some of the features we *have* implemented:
- Lickity Split Game (Singleplayer, Partial Implementation for Multiplayer)
- Swamp Spotting Game (Singleplayer or Multiplayer)

## Known Bugs:
- In Prelobby, multiplayer frogs are shown as the user's color instead of their chosen color.
- In Lickity Split Game, reaching the goal doesn't end the game + send you to the scoreboard screen for a few seconds.
- In Swamp Spotting Game, some animals are facing the wrong direction in multiplayer.
- Returning to the prelobby creates duplicates of the frogs.
- Scoreboard breaks in multiplayer.

As a team of newcomers to game development, this project also provides a unique opportunity to grow our skills in game design, networking, and the Unity engine, while contributing to a project that could offer both personal and professional rewards.
