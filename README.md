# Ribbit Royale
## Abstract
Ribbit Royale is an exciting and whimsical LAN party game designed to bring players together through fun, competitive, and engaging multiplayer minigames.
Featuring a playful art style and a variety of unique, frog-themed interactions, the game invites players to experience amusing challenges that leverage the distinct abilities of frogsâ€”such as swinging with their tongues, licking to interact with the environment, and even eating other players or flies.

## Objective
The objective is to provide a distinctive experience that blends competitive gameplay with quirky mechanics, making each mini-game feel fresh and enjoyable. Players can compete in up to four-player multiplayer mode, with a series of mini-games designed to test their skills and cooperation. Ribbit Royale offers at least three unique games with visually differentiated elements that make each challenge memorable and fun. Through the creation of this game, we aim to push the boundaries of the typical party game genre by incorporating fun mechanics that highlight the playful essence of frogs, making it not only an entertaining experience for players but also an intriguing marketable product. And best of all, our product will be made ***FREE***, putting us ahead of our competitors.
